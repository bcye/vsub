# vsub - Virtual subscribe
The idea of vsub is to make the usage of a Google account on youtube unnecessary.
I want to do this by building a website like the subcriptions page on youtube. You'll just need to enter a list of channel links to add them to your subs.

### Login/Sign-Up
The idea to store your subs is either to do this using cookies. You could then export/import them using a plain json or csv or whatever file.
Another option (since I want it to be focused on privacy) is that you use 2FA as a login method. The idea here is to let the user set a username and during set up the user needs to use Google Auth, which will generate a new password anytime.

## Contributing
I have created a collab on devrant for this project. [It can be found here](https://devrant.com/collabs/1304531).
The issue board will be used to keep track of tasks that need to be done. I am also planning to create gitter community (if necessary)
